ðŸ“© Submit a craftinfo or crafthelp

If you have a craftinfo or a crafthelp, create an issue and send a link to your repository. 
If it is accepted your repository will be cloned and end up here. You will be put
into the craftinfo organization, so that you can maintain your craftinfos.

Memo: the `-craftinfo` is there to disambiguate from the actual project (and the possibility of naming clashes in the cache).

## Craftinfo

A craftinfo is created whenever you say `mulle-sde craftinfo set` to tweak the build of a dependency.
It will contain various build flags or even a custom build script.

## Crafthelp

Many dependencies, maybe even most, don't need a special craftinfo. Possibly they don't even need any
tweaks to the dependency. Even then it is good to have a crafthelp, that either verifies that this
isn't needed or gives some help to the user, what he should do.
The help is just the README.md file in the repository.

A craftinfo is also a crafthelp and its README.md is also used.

## How to create a craftinfo repository

Lets say you are github user "moof" and you created a craftinfo for the project "dogcow".
Here is how it would look like:

``` bash
cd craftinfos/dogcow-craftinfo
git init
git add .
# vi README.md (nice this up)
git commit -m "* initial commit"
# create repo on github, or somewhere else
git remote add github git@github.com:moof/dogcow-craftinfo.git
# get LICENSE from github
git pull --allow-unrelated-histories github master
git push github
```
